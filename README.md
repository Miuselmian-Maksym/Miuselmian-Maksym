ðŸš€ Freelance Fullstack Developer | Python, Django, React

Hi, Iâ€™m Maksym â€” a passionate self-taught fullstack developer from Ukraine. While I donâ€™t have commercial experience yet, Iâ€™ve built multiple study and pet projects using **Django (REST API)** on the backend and **React.js** on the frontend. Iâ€™m confident in both areas and eager to take on real-world challenges.

### âœ… Why work with me:
- I write **clean, scalable, and maintainable code**
- I'm a **fast learner** â€” Iâ€™ll figure out solutions even for problems Iâ€™ve never faced before
- Iâ€™m open to **collaboration, freelance gigs, or startup environments**
- I offer **flexible hours** to match your timeline

Letâ€™s build something cool together!
